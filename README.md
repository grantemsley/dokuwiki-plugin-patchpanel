# Depreciated!

GreenItSolutions has done a great job with their fork at [switchpanel](https://github.com/GreenItSolutions/dokuwiki-plugin-switchpanel).  Since I haven't had time to maintain this project lately, I recommend using their plugin instead.

# dokuwiki-plugin-patchpanel
Plugin for patch panels based on Tyler Bletsch's rack plugin

added option to use with 3com style switches that have port 2 above port 1
